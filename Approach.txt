2D mapping
For Hector SLAM, I first installed the required packages for it to work.
Further, I made changes in the tutorial.launch file of hector_slam_launch, to make it work with the existing robot and world.
Launching this file opened rviz. I moved the robot around the map in gazzebo using the controller so that every part of the world could be covered.
Rviz showed the borders created using the LIDAR.

Stereo-camera
I added a stereo camera by modifying mobile_manipulator.urdf by adding code for the cameras. 
The structure of this code was taken from https://classic.gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_gzplugins
To confirm that the cameras were working, I opened rviz and added a camera to see the output.
This showed a few errors, which I later resolved by editing the frames.
Both cameras were then correctly showing up on rviz

Rtabmap
I created a launch file for recording the images into a database (Structure taken from http://wiki.ros.org/rtabmap_ros/Tutorials/SetupOnYourRobot#Stereo_B_.28recommended.29)
I moved the robot around in gazebo using the controller while the launch file created was running.
This created clouds of data from multiple points on the path of the robot and saved them to the database
I opened this database in rtabmap.
Most of the 3D map was fine but some points on the trajectory were off, leading to the clouds being formed in the wrong location. I was not able to fix this error.
I tried to create occupancy grid by using "Export 2D grid map" in rtabmap but the option was disabled. I was not able to resolve this issue.
